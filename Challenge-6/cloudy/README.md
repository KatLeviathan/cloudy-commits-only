## A website showing the weather for different cities using the openweather API


My Motivation for this project was learning how different API's work and how to implement them in my day to day work.
I built this project to further my skills as a front end developer and to understand API's and their different uses and functions. 
I discovered more API's than openweather and read a little more in to them as my project came closer together
